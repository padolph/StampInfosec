<br><br>

</li><li> Other useful resources:

<ul>

<li> <b><i>A Bug Hunter's Diary: A Guided Tour Through the Wilds 
of Software Security</i></b>, Tobias Klein, No Starch Press, 2011.
Lots of interesting real-world examples of vulnerable code.

</li><li> <b><i>Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software</i></b>, Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig,
No Starch Press, 2012. An excellent book for 
information on reverse engineering
(whether for malware analysis or other purposes).
Includes many hands-on exercises.

</li><li> <a href="http://reversingproject.info/">Software
Reverse Engineering (SRE)</a> website. This website,
which was created by a former masters student, includes
lots of good information and detailed exercises with solutions.

<!--
<li> <b><i>Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering</i></b>,
Eldad Eilam, Wiley, 2005, ISBN: 0764574817. This is the best book
available on reverse engineering software. The book also discusses 
various software protection techniques.
--> 

</li><li> <b><i>Network Security: Private Communication in a
Public World</i></b>, second edition, Charlie Kaufman, 
Radia Perlman, and
Mike Speciner, Prentice Hall, 2002, ISBN: 0-13-046019-2.
This book provides good coverage of cryptography and excellent 
coverage of several security protocols.

</li><li> <b><i>Security Engineering: A Guide to Building 
Dependable Distributed Systems</i></b>, Ross Anderson, John Wiley 
&amp; Sons, Inc., 2001, ISBN: 0-471-38922-6; see
Ross Anderson's <b><i>Security Engineering</i></b> website
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html</a>, where you can obtain 
a free (and legal) copy of the 1st edition of the book. 
This is an excellent book for an 
overview of security in general, but 
it is not too focused or technically detailed.

</li><li> <b><i>Security in Computing</i></b>, third edition,
Charles P. Pfleeger and Shari Lawrence Pfleeger, Prentice Hall,
2003, ISBN: 0-13-035548-8. The strength of this book is
its coverage of the security issues related to software. In particular, 
operating systems and some aspects
of secure software engineering are covered well. This book
also has some good, basic information on viruses.

</li><li> <b><i>Applied Cryptography: Protocols, 
Algorithms and Source Code in C</i></b>, second edition, Bruce Schneier,
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1995, ISBN: 0-471-11709-9.
For better or for worse, in industry, this is <i>the</i> 
standard reference for all things cryptographic.

</li><li> <b><i>Counter Hack Reloaded: A Step-by-Step 
Guide to Computer Attacks and Effective Defenses</i></b>,
Ed Skoudis with Tom Liston, Prentice Hall, 2006,
ISBN: 0-13-148104-5. There are many books that claim to
provide information on how to foil hackers, but this is
by far the best that I have seen. This is an updated version
of the original <b><i>Counter Hack</i></b>, published
in 2001.

</li><li> <b><i>Computer Viruses and Malware</i></b>,
John Aycock, Springer, 2006, ISBN: 0387302360.
This book gives a good introduction to research topics
related to malware. The book is well-written and 
surprisingly easy reading, given the technical nature
of the material.

</li><li> <b>Homework:</b> Homework is
due <i>typewritten</i> 
(include source code, but not executable files) 
by class starting time on the due date.
Each assigned problem requires a solution
and an explanation (or work) detailing
how you arrived at your solution.
Cite any outside sources used to solve a problem.
When grading an assignment,
I may ask for additional information.
A <i>subset</i> of the assigned problems
will be graded.

<br><br>

Zip your homework into a file named hmk.zip.
Email your work to <a href="mailto:cs166.sjsu@gmail.com">cs166.sjsu@gmail.com</a>. 
The subject line of your email <b><i>must</i></b> be of the form: 

<pre>     CS166HMK assignmentnumber yourlastname last4digitofyourstudentnumber 
</pre>

That is, the subject line must consist of four identifiers. 
There is no space within an identifier and each identifier 
is separated by a space.

</li><li> <b>University Policies</b>

<br><br>

<ul>

<li> <b>Academic integrity</b><br><br>

Your commitment as a student to learning is evidenced by your enrollment at San Jose State University.  The University's Academic Integrity policy, located at <a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/senate/S07-2.htm">http://www.sjsu.edu/senate/S07-2.htm</a>, requires you to be honest in all your academic course work. Faculty members are required to report all infractions to the office of Student Conduct and Ethical Development. The Student Conduct and Ethical Development website is available at <a href="http://www.sa.sjsu.edu/judicial_affairs/index.html">http://www.sa.sjsu.edu/judicial_affairs/index.html</a>. 
Instances of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Cheating on exams or plagiarism (presenting the work of another as your own, or the use of another person's ideas without giving proper credit) will result in a failing grade and sanctions by the University. For this class, all assignments are to be completed by the individual student unless otherwise specified. If you would like to include your assignment or any material you have submitted, or plan to submit for another class, please note that SJSU's Academic Policy S07-2 requires approval of instructors.
<br><br>

</li><li> <b>Campus Policy in Compliance with the American Disabilities Act</b><br><br>

If you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, or if you need to make special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please make an appointment with me as soon as possible, or see me during office hours. Presidential Directive 97-03 requires that students with disabilities requesting accommodations must register with the Disability Resource Center (DRC) at <a href="http://www.drc.sjsu.edu/">http://www.drc.sjsu.edu/</a> to establish a record of their disability.
